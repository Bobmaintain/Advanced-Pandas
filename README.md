# Advanced-Pandas
This repository will guide you in performing advance data manipulation in Python using the Pandas Package.


There are lots of data science libraries and modules that efficiently implement the most common data manipulation techniques. If you are a data scientist/analyst in python, you'll be familiar with NumPy and Pandas, among others.

Over some few years, I have been involved in training a number of data science/analytics enthusiasts. While not all of them have gone on to become renowned in the field, I've left them all better than I found them. However, I discovered that most of their struggles are rooted in not being able to actually get things done in a deeper way and at a higher level to achieve desired results, So I began to share some advanced knowledge to them from my developed training materials.

From my training materials, here are 3 major advanced topics that I believe will help you achieve better results in data manipulation:
1. Advanced NumPy
2. Advanced Pandas
3. GroupBy Mechanics.

Attached is Advanced Pandas.
The rest are also attached in my other posts.
Happy perusal!
